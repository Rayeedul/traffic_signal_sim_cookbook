New features and bugfixes in the SignalControl.DLL API              (2007-05-23)
======================================================
(+ = new features, - = bugs that have been fixed. 
 Details about the fixes are in brackets.)

(2007-05-23)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  Added support for silent mode of the simulation, using the code CONSOLE_MODE. 
  If this mode is set the controller should not display dialog boxes that wait 
  for user input.
  Added support for multirun and the parallel version of VISSIM. Both require
  that error file names contain the process id and simulation run index. 
  For this purpose VISSIM sends a number calculated as 
    process id * 100 + the index of the simulation run.
  After the simulation run the status of the controller is returned using the 
  code SC_DLL_DATA_TERMINATION, passing the error file name to VISSIM.
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Added an object iterator that allows to iterate over all signal groups or all
  detectors of the current SC.
  A detector additionally contains its name and its type. This version 
  differentiates between detectors for traffic and detectors for pedestrians. 
  A pedestrian detector is a detector that detects only vehicle types with 
  category pedestrian.
  New functions IsConsoleMode() and ProcessSimRunID() to determine the mode
  that VISSIM is in for display of error messages and output file names.
- lsa_puff.cpp:
  LongToLSAPuffer() deletes the list of PT telegrams at the start of the data
  passed for each SC if the controller frequency is >1, so CP_Telegrams() 
  returns always zero if more than one SC uses this controller DLL.

------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  New data type SC_DLL_DATA_SIM_DATE.
  lsa_puff.h/.cpp:
  New global variable SimulationDate.
  sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  New function Sim_Start_Date().

(2005-09-30)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  New data types SC_DLL_DATA_LICENSE_CONTROLLERS and SC_DLL_DATA_SIM_TIME_OF_DAY.
  lsa_puff.h/.cpp:
  New global variable SimulationTimeOfDay.
  sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  New function Sim_Time_of_Day().

(2005-05-02)
------------     
+ lsa_rahm.h: 
  CONTROLLER_DLL_NAME #defined as "simpledll.dll"
- sc_dll_functions.cpp: 
  SG_SetState() uses index in call of VonLSA() where it should use sg_no.
  This will cause calls of SG_SetState() to affect the wrong signal groups
  and can cause the signal controller DLL to crash.
